# comparison and logical operators

we using operators like (logical and comparison) to evaluate asituation by comparing one valueto another is expected to get me something :
 1. is equal to value (==)
 2. is equal to value and datatype (===)
 3. not equal to value (!=)
 4. not equal to value and datatype (!==)
 5. greater than (>)
 6. less than (<)
 7. greater than or equal (>=)
 8. less than or equal (<=)



we have tow components to a decision:
 1. an expression is evaluated (evaluating conditions)
 2. a conditional statement (if else statement)

types of loop :

 while :Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

 for :Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

     for (var i ; i<10; i++){
         document.write (i);
     }
