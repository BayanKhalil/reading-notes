# EJS PARTIALS

* Partials it's a layout  come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views


* it is as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.

* we creat folders `views` then `partials`folder then the files

* You can use the same partials in different page using include function and then add it wherever you need it to be added to.

* We can use that for repititive elements such as header and footer

* And its that simple how we can easily add chunks of reusable elements using EJS,express and NodeJS!
