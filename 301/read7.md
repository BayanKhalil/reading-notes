## What Google learned about from its quest to build the perfect team

* One of the best steps to working with an ideal team is to be comfortable in dealing with and not to be nervous about saying any idea if you do not get that but your team

*  teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything

* software engineers are encouraged to work together, in part because studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction
