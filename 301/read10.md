
# The Call Stack and Debugging

* A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc


* When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.

* The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous


* In Asynchronous JavaScript, we have a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop

* At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

## JavaScript error messages && debugging

* Types of errors in JavaScript:
 1-Reference errors 

 > console.log(foo) // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
 2-Syntax errors

 >JSON.parse( {'foo': 'bar'} ) // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o inJSON 

 3-Range errors

 ```
 var foo= []
foo.length = foo.length -1 // Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length
```

 4-Type errors
 
 ```
 var foo = {}
foo.bar // undefined
foo.bar.baz // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'baz' of undefined
```

> Best way to debug your code in javascript is to use console.log();
