 # markup the text
### 1. Structural markup :the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
- `<h1>`<h1> is used for main headings</h1>
- `<p>`<p>To create a paragraph</p>
- `<b>`<b> make characters appear bold</b>
- `<i>`<i>make characters appear italic</i>
- `<sup>`<sup> contain characters that should be superscript
- `<sub>`<sub> contain characters that should be subscript
- white space collapsing (but two or more spaces next to each other)
- `<br />`<br /> Line Breaks
- `<hr />`<hr /> horizontal rule


 ### 2. Semantic markup: which provides extra information
- `<strong>`<strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance.</strong>
- `<em>`<em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence(will show in italic)</em>
- `<blockquote>`<blockquote> element isused for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph
- `<q>`<q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.
- `<abbr>`<abbr> element can be used A title attribute on the opening tag isused to specify the full term.
- `<cite>`<cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
- `<dfn>`<dfn> element is used toindicate the defining instance of a new term.
- `<address>`<address> contain contact details for the author of the page.
- `<ins>`<ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while
- `<del>`<del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.
- `<s>`<s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but thatshould not be deleted)</s>

# css
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.

# javascript
- A script is made up of a series of statements, Statements should end with a semicolon.
- javscript have variables and theres arule we should follow when naming the var
1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_);It must not start
with a number.
2. The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or aperiod (.) in a variable name.
3. You cannot use reserved words
4. use meaningful name that describe the var
5. If your variable name is madeup of more than one word,using camelcase

* when you creating an array it possible have var contain different data type (string,numbers,..)
* we have tow type of array
  1.array literal (using var [])
  2.array constructor (using Array())

  Expressions rely on things called operators:
 1. assignment
 2. arithmetic
 3. string
 4. comparison
 5. logical

 # Decisions
  we have tow components to a decision:
 1. an expression is evaluated (evaluating conditions)
 2. a conditional statement allow your code to make decisions about what to do next(if else statement).

 * Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
 * Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

         && (and) , ||(or)  ,  !(not)
         
 * if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
