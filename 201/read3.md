# Layout
Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
1. Building Blocks :CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
This box will either be a block-level which start in anew line` <h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
box or an inline box. flow in between surrounding text`<img> <b> <i>`
2. Containing Elements: If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

* CSS has the three positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:
 `normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.`

 * To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties
  if it  `Fixed Positioning ` or  `Floating Elements `

# javascript

  functions and method and objects :
  **function**: consist of a series of statements that have been grouped together because they perform aspecific tak 
  **method**: is the same as function ,except methods are created inside and part of object

  **objects**: we use it create models of the world using data and it made up of properties and methods 

types of function
  1. declaring function

   return document.write('hello'); 
}
sayHello();
```
2. expresstion function
```
var showImage = function() {
    code...code
}
showImage();
```

*variable scope* :

The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.
1. When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword, it can only be used in that function. its called 
**local var**

2. If you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script.its called **global var**
