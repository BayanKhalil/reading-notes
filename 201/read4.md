Adding Images 
To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>`
element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes: `src` ,`alt`,`title`
`title` :to provide additional information about the image.
`alt` :This provides a text description of the image
`src` :This tells the browser where it can find the image file.
* You will also often see an `<img>`element use two other attributesthat specify  its size:`height & width`
### Where to Place Images in Your Code
1. before a paragraph
2. inside the start of a paragraph
3. in the middle of a paragraph
`align` 
* You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# colors
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
` rgb values` : red green blue value
 `hex codes` : red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
 `color names`: Colors are represented by predefined names.
  
  * Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
  * It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).


 # text 
  V
  There are properties to control the choice of font, size,weight, style, and spacing.
  1. Specifying Typefaces by `font-family`
  2. size of type by `font-size`
  * The default size of text in a browser is 16 pixels.
  3. Bold by : `font-weight`
  4. italic : `font-style`
  5. UpperCase & LowerCase by: `text-transform`
  6. Underline & strike by :`text-decoration`
  7. Leading :`line-height`
  8. Lett er & Word Spacing : `letter-spacing, word-spacing`
  9. Alignment : `text-align`
  10. Vertical Alignment:`vertical-align`
  11. Drop Shadow :`text-shadow`

  There are also a set of attribute selectors that allow you to create rules that apply to elements that have an attribute with a specific value. see the figure
